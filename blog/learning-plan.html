          <h3 class="titanfont">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
         <P>Just to give you some background, before coming to EDA, I worked as a landscaper, which at the
          time was something I was very passionate about to the point that I had plans to one day start
          my own landscaping company, but after our lockdown in August of '21, I had a lot of time to think
           about my life and my career. I have a young whanau, whose time and company I value greatly, and
          I discovered that working in the landscaping industry didn't really allow for time for that,
           I realised that work time was taking priority over whanau time, especially since I was a 
           supervisor and was required to be on site at all times. I didn't like this outcome, so I 
           began looking for other career choices that would be more in line with my whanau values 
           among other reasons this was the most important. My long-term objective is to become a digital 
           nomad hippie. I appreciate the possibility of remote work that this industry gives and that I 
           can still express my artistic side to some extent, like I could with landscaping. Career 
           advancement and up skilling are also important to me, which this industry also provides 
           as the tech industry is forever evolving so there's always room to skill and career growth.
         </P>

         <h3 class="titanfont">A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
         <p>I'm still learning how to recognise my strengths and weaknesses, but I consider myself to be a committed and eager learner who is always determined to finish whatever she starts. I also have the capacity to accept and learn from mistakes and constructive criticism for improvement, as well as being honest and kind.
           However, I can occasionally display forms of self-doubt that can hinder work performance,
           and I discovered this week that I might set my standards a little too high, i was set on having my page exactly 
           how i had it planned in my draft which resulted in me spending too much unecassary time on a particular area 
           disregarding the time box and poorly handling time. 
          </p>
         <br>
         <h3 class="titanfont">What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
         <p>I would really like to improve my communication and organisational abilities so that I can express my point 
           or concept clearly and concisely while also managing my workload to avoid working long hours.
          </p>
         <br>
         <h3 class="titanfont">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
         <p>Setting realistic goals and avoiding perfectionism will help me manage my time more effectively. I should also break up larger
           activities into smaller ones and make a checklist to help with workflow in addition to that If things start to get stressful and I start to struggle, I'll take a break, perhaps go for a walk, and put my attention somewhere for a while. 
           If necessary, I'll also seek out and chat to someone.
          </p>
         <br>
         <h3 class="titanfont">A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
         <p>simply to be genuine and offer direct criticism and feedback that is constructive in order
           to lead and inspire me to continue developing myself, and to be supportive and sympathetic
        </p>
         <br>
         <h3 class="titanfont">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
         <p>I wasted a lot of time this week attempting to figure out a problem on my own before approaching peers; if I had done
           so earlier, my time would have been better handled. As a result, I will seek assistance rather than continuing to
           dwell on a problem once I've exhausted all of my options and am unable to fix it.
          </p>
