          <h3 class="titanfont">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>

            <li>
              <p>
                I really feel like my sense of self awareness has grown. At first, it was challenging for me to write about myself in the
                core sections, but I saw that it became easier each week as I got to know myself a little better.
              </p>
            </li>
               <br>
            <li>
              <p>
                I struggled to ask for help whenever I was stuck in first couple of sprints, I had to swallow my pride and reach out, because otherwise I wouldn't
                have been able to turn in my work on time and I just wouldn't have been helping myself.
              </p>
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>
              <p>
                I learned that I'm much more determined than I originally believed. Learning JS and having to use it in projects was definitely stressful and difficult,
                but my resolve to finish it and not give up made me persevere.
              </p>
            </li>
           </ul>

         <h3 class="titanfont">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
            <br>
         <ul class="no-bullets">
          <li>
            <p>
              Empathy is the action of understanding, being aware of and being sensitive to the feelings of others. It's a valuable
              skill to have in a work place and life in general as it enables people to identify problems others may be facing and, from there, develop solutions,
              Given that you frequently work in teams and interact with others, this is a very useful ability to have.
            </p>
          </li>
             <br>
          <li>
            <p>
              With self awareness, I believe you become more conscious of the effect you have in a setting where you, sort of, fit into the machine I suppose.
              If you make a mistake, you're aware that it affects not only you but also potential coworkers, clients, and others who may be working on the same task as you.
            </p>
          </li>
              <br>
          <li>
            <p>
              Values are important because they influence our beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours. For instance, the value of integrity may be applied to all workplaces since
              it encourages people to provide services with the best of intentions.
            </p>

         <h3 class="titanfont">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
         <br>
         <p>
           The depth with which we covered every subject surprised me the most, many of the questions were thought-provoking,
           and not stuff I've ever taken into account before.
         </p>
         <br>
         <h3 class="titanfont">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
         <br>
         <p>
           I think I may have mentioned this before. But writing about myself, my thoughts and feelings, and simply that whole thing was incredibly difficult. 
         </p>
         <br>
         <h3 class="titanfont">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
         <br>
         <p>
          I think it's been mentioned a few times that it's to help us become more employable by teaching valuable human skills that we can use in the workplace.
         </p>
         <br>
         <h3 class="titanfont">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
         <br>
         <p>
           No, to be completely honest, I don't feel like it was wasted at all. It was interesting to learn more about subjects I already familiar. However, I feel like I spent much too much time on some of these core blogs since, as I said above,
           it was challenging to write about myself.
