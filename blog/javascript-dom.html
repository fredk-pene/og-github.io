    <h2 class="titanfont" >An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h2>
    <div class="robofont">
     <P>
       Let's say we're building a flat-pack, In the same way that HTML contains the text, image, and other building
       pieces for your website. Each flat-pack box comes with an instruction manual containing  both text and images 
       that demonstrate how to put the flat-pack together.  Using the instructions and materials supplied, we can construct 
       our flatpack similarly to how you would use CSS to design items on a website that might need to be aligned, displayed ,
       or positioned in a particular location in order to function (assuming we've just put together a cabinet  we are then, 
       blessed with doors that might have knobs or handles which open and close adding functionality to our cabinet), 
       similarly to how Javascript can add functionality or change elements to our HTML document via the dom.

      <h2 class="titanfont" >Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h2>
      <div class="robofont">
        <p>
         The order and sequence for when our code is run in a script is known as the control flow. Control flow is 
         needed if a piece of code needs to be run repeatedly but with a different value each time.  Furthermore for as 
         long as a condition is met, a loop executes the same code repeatedly. Using breakfast as a metaphor example process,
         (assuming you're not a hobbit and only have breakfast once a day), you're daily breakfast would be an example of 
         control flow , but if you are a hobbit and partake in consumption of multiple breakfasts meals you could compare 
         that to loopingâ€¦.

      <h2 class="titanfont" >Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h2>
      <div class="robofont">
        <p>
          The Document Object Model otherwise known as DOM, is a programming interface for HTML web documents. 
          The program allows us to to create change or remove elements from a web document giving our page more functionality,
          making it more dynamic. We can access these elements in the HTML document and make changes to them using JavaScript.

          The DOM consists of a tree structure of nested nodes created by the browser that makes it possible for programming
          languages to readily access the HTML structure. This tree structure is often referred to as the DOM tree , commonly
          likened to an ancient family tree, which includes parents, children, and siblings , (depending on their relationship
          to other nodes, all nodes will sit somewhere in that family category, parents , children ect).</p>

      <h2 class="titanfont" >Differences between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
      <div class="robofont">
        <p>
          Arrays can access data using index, whereas Objects access data using strings, in the picture below is an example
          i've put together.

    <h2 class="titanfont" >Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h2>
      <div class="robofont">
        <p>
           A function is a block of code that works almost like a mini-program. It's
           used to perform certain actions that only run when it's called/activated. Functions 
           can also be used multiple times, rather than writing the same code out multiple times 
           you can condense it it into a function saving you a lot of time. In the images below,
           I've included examples from the scrimba course. Rather than writing out console.log,
           we condensed it into a function, called/activated it with countdown()(key). The outcome is the
           same without the hassle of having to write out console. log several times, while also 
           cleaning up our code .
