          <br>
         <P>Four years ago I transitioned into a predominantly plant based diet and the key
          reason for that is because of the environmental impacts caused by the agriculture 
          industry in Aotearoa, As tangata whenua  I believe it is my responsibility to 
          minimise the impact I have on Papatūānuku & Tangaroa for future tamariki, in addition
          to that my Whanau and I like to grow our own produce allowing us to become more self sustainable.
         </P>
         <br>
         <h3 class="titanfont">Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
         <p>Integrity, perseverance and a strong work ethic will aid me in the journey of this
          course, I have a strong willingness to learn and challenge myself which is 
          something that can also translate into other aspects in life.
         </p>

          <p>
           As a former senior gardener and foreman in the landscape sector for the previous two and a half years, 
           I have frequently had to assign tasks and manage projects. I've had to mediate disputes with two 
           employees on a few occasions because they were struggling to finish duties that were given to them.
           I had to have a conversation with them and devise a schedule for how they were to divide their time 
           so that jobs were performed for our clients in a timely matter. The best course of action, in my 
           opinion, is to speak with my co-workers as soon as a problem arises rather than letting it linger. 
           Being able to have those difficult talks with co-workers can present challenges since I am aware
           that some people find it difficult to separate themselves from their personal issues and bring them
           to work, but my policy is to be upfront, open, and honest. Another strategy I would try is checking
           in with workers and seeing how they are going, this may help catch an issue before it becomes a problem.
