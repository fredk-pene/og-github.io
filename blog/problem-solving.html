         <P>
           I'll be honest and say that for the vast majority of the Kata, every obstacle I encountered, regardless of how easy or 
           difficult, had a simple solution. I would shake my head when I realised how simple the answer actually was. I felt a touch out of
           my depth and a little lacking in confidence throughout the entirety of the Kata's, but I have since learned not to overthink the 
           solution as per i was overcomplicating simple tasks and putting in too much thought, it was  helpful when I broke down each step into
           smaller pieces rather than attempting to understand the entire test
           at once. One simple problem that happens to stand out the most was proably during the the capatalize test, all i had to do to pass the
           test was to add a space in my join & map array (example below) to pass it... Gotta keep an eye out for those cheeky
           case sensitive errors aswell, the amount of time spent going over my code to see what the problem was just to realise it was because of 
           capitalization.

         <h3 class="titanfont">"ELEGANTLY" SOLVED A PROBLEM</h3>
         <p>
           I'm not sure if "elegant" is the right word to describe this, but while I was doing the super FizzBuzz kata, I decided 
           to use the map method instead of the for loop method suggested in the hints because through doing the Js method research I 
           learnt that it does the same thing essentially . I wasn't entirely sure, though, if it would work, but it did, and I was 
           preeeetty chuffed with the results, so trying something different worked well for me on this one.
         </p>

         <h3 class="titanfont">REFLECT ON HOW CONFIDENT YOU FEEL ABOUT USING THE PROBLEM-SOLVING TECHNIQUES/PROCESSES</h3>
         <p>
           I can't speak for all of these because I only used a few of them, namely, Googling, Asking peers & Facilitators for help, and Trying 
           Something so I wouldn't say i'm too confident in the other processes I haven't touched on. I tried the rubber ducky method, but I 
           felt like I got more out of hearing the different perspectives of others than I did from talking to my house plants, they just didn't
           do it for me. I definitely found google to be helpful as I would often forget the syntax structure of some Js statements so a quick little Google would set me straight. 
           I found console.logging beneficial as well, letting my know what certain lines of code was doing  . In the end, seeking advice 
           from others when I was struggling helped the most and  because even if what they said was vague, it helped me view my problem from 
           a different angle helping make sense of things i was stuck on.
