Identity, Values, and Strengths Exploration

Four years ago I transitioned into a predominantly plant based diet and the key
reason for that is because of the environmental impacts caused by the agriculture 
industry in Aotearoa, As tangata whenua  I believe it is my responsibility to 
minimise the impact I have on Papatūānuku & Tangaroa for future tamariki, in addition
 to that my Whanau and I like to grow our own produce allowing us to become
  more self sustainable.

Integrity, perseverance and a strong work ethic will aid me in the journey of this
course, I have a strong willingness to learn and challenge myself which is 
something that can also translate into other aspects in life.
As a senior gardener and foreman in the landscape sector for the previous two and a half years, 
I have frequently had to assign tasks and manage projects. I've had to mediate disputes with two 
employees on a few occasions because they were struggling to finish duties that were given to them.
I had to have a conversation with them and devise a schedule for how they were to divide their time 
so that jobs were performed for our clients in a timely matter. The best course of action, in my 
opinion, is to speak with my co-workers as soon as a problem arises rather than letting it linger. 
Being able to have those difficult talks with co-workers can present challenges since I am aware
that some people find it difficult to separate themselves from their personal issues and bring them
to work, but my policy is to be upfront, open, and honest. Another strategy I would try is checking
 in with workers and seeing how they are going, this may help catch an issue before it becomes a problem.
